KingAOP
=======

It's an AOP framework which is essentially a free alternative of PostSharp. If you familiar with PostSharp, then you can notice that KingAOP has even the same interfaces to interract with you:)

The concept of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) offers an interesting alternative for the specification of non-functional component properties (such as fault-tolerance properties or timing behaviour), as well as other crosscutting concerns. These are implemented as so-called aspects and at some point "weaved" to the other functional parts of the software.
